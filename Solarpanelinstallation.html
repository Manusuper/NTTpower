<h1>Info about Solar panel installation in Belgium</h1>
<p>In Belgium, the rules and regulations for installing solar panels can vary slightly depending on the region (Flanders, Wallonia, or Brussels). Here are some general guidelines:
Regarding Permits and Notifications: In most cases, you do not need a building permit to install solar panels on a roof, provided they are integrated into the roof and do not alter the building's structure.
Regarding Technical Requirements:
The installation must comply with regional technical standards and safety regulations.
And after installation, the system must be inspected and certified by a recognized body to ensure it meets all safety and technical standards.
